# flightsimlib
Flight Simulator C++ Common libs

## Features
This library provides a thin (mostly) cross-platform abstraction for BGL File Decompression. This allows one to read raw compressed data from a ESP-based (FSX, ESP, P3D) resample-compressed BGL file.

## Roadmap
* Docs to come
* Sample code / integration
* Open-source more functionality of my libraries of common Flight Sim code
