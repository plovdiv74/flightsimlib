# flightsimlib examples
Flight Simulator C++ Common libs - example code


## Usage
A basic decompression example is given based on the Death Valley elevations sample from the FSX SDK.
Note that there is no BGL-file parsing capability yet, this will be added in future versions.

The code can be built with the provided Visual Studio project or easily ported to other platforms.

Please [see the wiki](https://github.com/seanisom/flightsimlib/wiki) for basic usage.

NOTE - if you are missing the header or the .lib to link to in this solution, build the parent flightsimlib.sln first - it will xcopy these to the examples folder.
